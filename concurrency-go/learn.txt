Goroutines
- Lightweight thread managed by go runtime
- Enable creating asynchronous parallel programs

WaitGroups
- used to block a certain block of code until another goroutines have successfully executed
- WaitGroups essentially allow us to tackle the problem by blocking it until any goroutines within a
  waitGroup have successfully executed
