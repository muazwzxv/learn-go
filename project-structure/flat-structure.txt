Small Application - Flat Structure

application/ 
	- main.go
	- main-test.go
	- utils.go
	- utils_test.go
	- ..... etc

- This structure is suitable for small project, but note that once the project get bigger
  this structure will become messy

Benefits 
	- Microservices :- Great use case if the application is tiny and is deployed in a distributed
	  fahsion. These program are meant to do just one thing



Medium/Large size Application - Modularization

go-api/
	- main.go
	- user/
		- user.go
		- login.go
		- registration.go
	- article/
		- articles.go
	- utils/ 
		- utils.go
